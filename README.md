Accurate predictions will help stakeholders make informed decisions about their investments.

gained insights can help create a positive business impact by identifying trends in the data. For example, the high average closing price in January suggests that the business did well that month. The low average closing price in February suggests that the business may have experienced some challenges during that month. However, the overall trend is positive, which suggests that the business is on track to achieve its goals. There are no insights that lead to negative growth.

Data Wrangling
Changing date column datatype to datetime format.
Creating separate columns for month and year from the date column for better visualization.

Modeling Process
Train-Test Split: Dataset split into 80% training and 20% testing.

Models Applied:

Linear Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
Model Evaluation:

Linear Regression provided the best performance based on MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE scores.

Results
Linear Regression: Best performance with lowest errors.
Ridge Regression: Reduced multicollinearity but negatively impacted evaluation metrics.
Lasso Regression: Performed feature selection but had higher errors than Ridge.
